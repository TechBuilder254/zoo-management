# Supabase Email Verification Setup Guide

## Overview
Your Wildlife Zoo system now includes Supabase email verification. Users must verify their email address before they can log in to the system.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Supabase Authentication Service** (`frontend/src/services/supabaseAuthService.ts`)
- Complete Supabase authentication integration
- Email verification during registration
- Login validation that checks email verification status
- Password reset functionality
- Session management

### 2. **Email Verification Page** (`frontend/src/pages/VerifyEmail.tsx`)
- Dedicated page for email verification status
- Handles verification redirects from email links
- Resend verification email functionality
- Clear status indicators (loading, success, error, pending)

### 3. **Updated Authentication Context** (`frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Integrated with Supabase authentication
- Real-time session management
- Email verification status tracking
- Automatic redirect handling

### 4. **Enhanced User Registration** (`frontend/src/pages/Register.tsx`)
- Newsletter subscription option
- Automatic redirect to verification page after registration
- Proper error handling

### 5. **Updated Login Flow** (`frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`)
- Email verification check before login
- Automatic redirect to verification page if email not verified
- Enhanced error messages

## Supabase Configuration Required

### 1. **Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. **Supabase Dashboard Settings**
In your Supabase project dashboard:

1. **Authentication Settings**:
   - Go to Authentication > Settings
   - Enable "Email confirmations"
   - Set "Email confirmation URL" to: `http://localhost:3000/verify-email` (for development)
   - For production: `https://yourdomain.com/verify-email`

2. **Email Templates** (Optional):
   - Customize the confirmation email template
   - Go to Authentication > Email Templates
   - Modify the "Confirm signup" template

3. **Site URL**:
   - Set Site URL to your frontend URL
   - For development: `http://localhost:3000`
   - For production: `https://yourdomain.com`

### 3. **Database Setup**
The system will automatically create users in Supabase's `auth.users` table. You may want to create a trigger to sync users to your custom `users` table if needed.

## How It Works

### Registration Flow:
1. User fills out registration form
2. System creates account in Supabase with email verification required
3. Supabase sends verification email to user
4. User redirected to `/verify-email` page
5. User clicks verification link in email
6. User redirected back to verification page with success status
7. User can now log in

### Login Flow:
1. User enters credentials
2. System checks if email is verified
3. If not verified: Shows error and redirects to verification page
4. If verified: User logs in successfully

### Email Verification Page Features:
- **Loading State**: While checking verification status
- **Success State**: Email verified successfully
- **Error State**: Verification failed
- **Pending State**: Waiting for user to verify email
- **Resend Function**: Allows resending verification email

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. **Test Registration**:
```bash
# Start the frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```
- Go to `/register`
- Fill out the form with a real email address
- Check that you're redirected to `/verify-email`
- Check your email for verification link

### 2. **Test Email Verification**:
- Click the verification link in your email
- You should be redirected back to the verification page
- Status should show "Email Verified!"
- You should be redirected to login after 3 seconds

### 3. **Test Login**:
- Try logging in before verifying email (should fail)
- Verify your email first
- Try logging in again (should succeed)

### 4. **Test Resend Verification**:
- On the verification page, click "Resend Verification Email"
- Check your email for a new verification link

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid login credentials"**:
   - Make sure email is verified first
   - Check Supabase dashboard for user status

2. **Verification email not received**:
   - Check spam folder
   - Verify email templates in Supabase dashboard
   - Check Supabase logs for email delivery issues

3. **Redirect issues**:
   - Make sure Site URL is correctly set in Supabase
   - Verify email confirmation URL matches your frontend URL

4. **Environment variables**:
   - Double-check your Supabase URL and anon key
   - Make sure `.env` file is in the frontend directory

## Security Features
