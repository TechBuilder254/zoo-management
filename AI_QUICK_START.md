## 🔧 Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your FREE Hugging Face API Key

1. Go to https://huggingface.co/join
2. Sign up (takes 30 seconds)
3. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
4. Click "New token" → Name it "zoo-sentiment" → Role: "read"
5. Copy the token (starts with `hf_...`)

### Step 2: Create Environment File

1. Copy `frontend/.env.local.example` to `frontend/.env.local`
2. Paste your Hugging Face API key:

```env
REACT_APP_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_key_here
REACT_APP_ENABLE_SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS=true
```

### Step 3: Run the App

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 4: Test It!

1. Go to any animal detail page
2. Write a review: "This zoo is amazing!"
3. Submit the review
4. You'll see: 😊 Positive (95%)

**That's it! Your first AI feature is working!** 🎉

## 💡 Features Included

### ✅ Smart Fallback
If the API fails or no key is provided, it uses keyword matching as fallback

### ✅ Caching
Results are cached for 10 minutes to save API calls

### ✅ Loading States
Shows loading indicator while analyzing

### ✅ Error Handling
Gracefully handles errors without breaking the app

### ✅ Dark Mode Support
Sentiment badges work in both light and dark themes

---

## 🧪 Test Without API Key

The system has a fallback that works WITHOUT an API key!

It uses simple keyword matching:
- "amazing", "great", "love" → 😊 Positive
- "terrible", "bad", "hate" → 😞 Negative
- Everything else → 😐 Neutral

So you can test it immediately even without API keys!

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Sentiment Colors

Edit `frontend/src/components/reviews/SentimentBadge.tsx`:

```typescript
const config = {
  POSITIVE: {
    emoji: '🌟', // Change emoji
    color: 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800', // Change colors
    text: 'Great!', // Change text
  },
  // ... customize others
};
```

### Adjust Sentiment Threshold

Edit `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
REACT_APP_SENTIMENT_THRESHOLD=0.8  # Higher = stricter
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Sentiment badge not showing
**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure `.env.local` is in `frontend/` folder
3. Restart the dev server

### Issue: "API key not found" error
**Solution:**
1. Verify `.env.local` exists and has `REACT_APP_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`
2. Restart dev server (important!)
3. Check key starts with `hf_`

### Issue: Sentiment is always neutral
**Solution:**
- This is the fallback working! Get your API key for better accuracy
- Or write more obvious positive/negative words
